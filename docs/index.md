###### Operating System as a Service

Building on the principles of distributed systems, and the legacy of Unix and Plan 9 operating systems, spore aims to become a testbed for fracturing the concept of operating system completely.

# About

## Von Neumann Doesn't Live Here Anymore

Remarkably, as his model of a computation engine ages the lack of reproach 
towards its false and now increasingly irrelevant assumptions, the name is still 
very important. Yes, because there will always be small processing units, that 
have to be sub-nanosecond synchronised.

But... for everything else, we have a spectrum of different levels of latency 
and synchronisation problems to deal with.

### `spore` is that everything else.

Spore is at first simply an execution shell that fetches, caches, compiles, configures and runs packages, a shell, built on a uniform system of child process control that has been written to abstract the OS differences.

Next is an interactive shell version, built as a GUI, and moving to the notion of pipes to other processes (or sockets, for remote) becoming widgets that can have multiple representations, the most simple one being output of strings of text, and the implementation of a codec for Gio Ops and Events, generated by the serving application, relayed through a pipe and rendered by the controlling shell application. Further modularity also, in creating separated streams, so views can contain views that are controlled by other processes, to embed types of data with sizes, for example, that don't suit frequent modification nor need it.
